# Encryption

## What is this?

This constitutes my bespoke cryptographic framework for my culminating academic endeavor, which entails the creation of a communication platform. The pertinent source code for said platform may be discovered at the [following location](https://github.com/benni347/abschluss_arbeit).

## Encryption Stack

The cryptographic assemblage employed within this undertaking harnesses both Post-Quantum Computing (PQC) and conventional encryption methodologies. The algorithms incorporated herein comprise [CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml), [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Furthermore, this stack incorporates a hashing mechanism utilizing the [Blake2b](https://www.blake2.net/) algorithm, generating a 512-bit hash.
